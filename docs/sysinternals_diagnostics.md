## Key Activities

### 1. Monitor CPU Usage and Running Processes
- **Process Explorer**:
  - Open Process Explorer.
  - Observe CPU usage, memory usage, and running processes.
  - Identify any processes using excessive resources.

### 2. Monitor Disk Health
- **Disk Usage (du)**:
  - Run `du` on a specific directory to analyze disk usage.
- **WinObj**:
  - Use WinObj to view and manage system objects.

### 3. Analyze System Performance
- **Process Monitor (ProcMon)**:
  - Open ProcMon to monitor file system, registry, and process activity.
  - Filter events to focus on specific processes or activities.
  - Analyze the logs to identify performance bottlenecks.
